# Face Recognition Using a Machine Learning Technique

This is a web app that  allows  the user to upload a image (sample images are provided in the folder test_sample). The app then detects and recognizes (outputs a face id) the uploaded face image if it is present in the database (Yale Face Database has been used to build the app). PCA and KNN has been used to build the classifier.
