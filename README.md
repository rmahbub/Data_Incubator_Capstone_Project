# Face Recognition Using a Machine Learning Technique

The repository contains decription and codes for the project titled "Face Recognition and Face Processing using a Machine Learning Technique".

The detail analysis and decription of the Project can be found here:

https://rmahbub.github.io/Data_Incubator_Project_Details/

The detail codes used for the analysis can be found here:

The repository also contains the codes for a flask based web app that  allows  the user to upload a image (sample images are provided in the folder test_sample). The app then detects and recognizes (outputs a face id) the uploaded face image if it is present in the database (Yale Face Database has been used to build the app). PCA and KNN have been used to build the classifier.
